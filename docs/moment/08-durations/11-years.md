As with the other getters for durations, `moment.duration().years()` gets the years.

`moment.duration().asYears()` gets the length of the duration in years.

Note that both `moment.duration().years()` and `moment.duration().asYears()` return output that does not meet the ISO 8601 *nominal duration* or the RFC 5545 *duration* standards.
